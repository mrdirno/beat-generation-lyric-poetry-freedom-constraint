## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a poem from the perspective of a city object (a fire escape, a manhole cover, a streetlight) witnessing a moment of human vulnerability.
- Create a dialogue between Jack and the mysterious figure under the bridge. What deal, challenge, or revelation is offered?
- Describe Nina's apartment. What artifacts of their shared, struggling artistic life fill the space? What's on the page of her own notebook?
- Extend the scene: Jack arrives at Nina's. What unspoken tensions exist beneath their banter? What does the 'terrible wine' or 'last of the bread' symbolize for them?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Grimy Cathedral' generator: a text engine that combines urban imagery (dripping pipes, exhaust, graffiti) with sacred liturgical language to create spontaneous prose poems.
- Create an 'Elysium' performance simulator: a web app where users can input a poem and receive simulated audience reactions (shifting shadows, scattered applause, a single chuckle, the jukebox cutting in) based on textual analysis of its rhythm and density.
